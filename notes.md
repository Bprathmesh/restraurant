cdn links->content delivery network  a place where react library is hosted  Why
Okay so if we fetch from cdn link then there are 2 links one is core react and other is react dom 
cdn links help us get whole code or inject it into our project 

About web page what we can say is that the most heavy operation a browser goes through is  dom manipulation so react came in picture to optimise it when we have to do anything in browser do it through js 
//react.create element at the end is a obj only 

React element is an object and it becomes html browser understandable   
React element can also be written without jsx using react create element 
JSX
